                        <p>
                            Attention deficient and hyperactive disorder (ADHD), Dyslexia, and Autism spectrum disorder (ASD).  The transition from high school to a college environment is difficult for most students and often more stressful for adolescents with learning differences. Overseas education and the barrage of questions from parents, students, and local schools is a bigger challenge by itself. Not many Universities or colleges in India cater to a formal Bachelors’ or Masters’ degree for such candidates, and hence most of these them take up softer courses like bakery, photography, painting, or such allied studies. There isn’t a clearly defined career path for such students to join and compete with the mainstream students (for example Engineering, Computer Science, Pure Science, Business administration, Arts etc) . GoWorld aims to bridge the gaps by being a guiding beacon for kids with SLD to study and succeed at reputed Universities globally both at the Undergraduate and Graduate levels. GoWorld performs a detailed study for each student to understand the following, capability, student’s expertise, program interest, affordability, ROI, job opportunities and post-study stay back against probable foreign Universities for bachelors/associate or Master’s degree

And while 35 percent will attempt to attend college later, most do not get admitted or they do but then drop out. Though many colleges and universities provide an array of services to students with learning or physical disabilities, those with ASD have needs that extend beyond the classroom, and their success in the classroom is directly implicated in those needs. GoWorld helps such students both succeed academically and professionally.</p>

A traditional four-year college may not be the right choice for everybody, but there are other options to consider, including an associate degree lasting two or three years.</p>

                           <p>My journey started 32 years ago, working with differently-abled children and their families. Working closely with them made me realise, that all children had an innate potential and inherent motivation to learn, and had a right to an optimal learning space.  This belief led me to work with administrators on policies; teachers on pedagogic practices in rural, special, CBSE, ICSC and Cambridge Schools in the southern states of India. The objective was to ensure a secure, organic and material rich learning space for children.  Realising the importance of capacity building in teachers led to focus on teacher training and authoring chapters in a book published by Sage Publishers “Within Walls Without Boundaries” and a book on “Understanding Best Inclusive Practices in Schools” by Seva-in-Action, and a Master Trainer Manual on “Promoting Reading” by IBM and The Promise Foundation. As Trustee and Director of MIRRA Charitable Trust; an initiative “ABIVIDHI”, a collaborative eco-system of schools; NGOs, parents and professionals to make inclusion a reality was initiated in Chennai.  Worked with KFI and Chennai Corporation on developing an Universal Curriculum for Primary, to meet the needs of every child in the class, irrespective of differences.</p>
